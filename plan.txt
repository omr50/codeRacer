How to create a C++ type racer

Worry about the syntax and formatting later

For now find out how to display basic text and as you type
the string of text will highlight yellow or red depending on
whether or not you typed it in correctly.

1. Display text ( figure out how to randomly generate a C++ text (can use random number 
and arrays with things like variable types, variable names, then randomly include loops
functions, etc))

2. Add and event listener which will be on the entire page. Once the user clicks, the timer
will activate and then every time a key is pressed which is within the range of keys a-z 1-9 and
all other ones like .,/[];'{} etc it wilkl be added to a string we made. This string will then compare
to the original string of text. For each letter that matches, we change color to yellow  and if they dont
we change it to red. (reference that video for type racer for more info)

3. Once the user wins, congratulate them and send them to the results page which stores their results using
local storage and also give them the option to retry or go back to home to try another language.

4. Also can put a navbar with all this stuff like languages and home and results page. Results will use the
results from local storage. Can have like 3 charts/graphs which contain high score for each language, average
score, accuracy, etc. It will say no results yet if there are none for a specific language but if there is 
results in local storage it will use it to show in the list. Default text would be N/A but then it can be 
changed to the numbers using local results. Dont need any special thing for chart just do a very simple and
neat layout for each language where you have high score, average, and accuracy and either N/A or use local data.
If no data at all then just display at top you have not played yet and still keep the charts but have N/A.
