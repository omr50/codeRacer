Made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and bootstrap. Used random
word api to retreive random dictionary words. Created an algorithm
for generating random programs and another algorithm for giving instant
feedback to the user as they type out to prompt. After you finish typing
out the prompt you will be redirected to the stats page which will show your
words per minute (wpm), accuracy, mistakes, and all time best (max score) which 
is stored with local storage so that you can keep your max score even if you leave
the page.

It was really fun to build this project especially since I got to sharpen my DOM
manipulation skills. Its always fun to use vanilla JS.
